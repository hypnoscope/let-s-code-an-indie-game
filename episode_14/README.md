#Let's Code and Indie Game - Episode 14 - Cabinet Projection

##What's Covered

In this episode we switch to use a cabinet projection (our player moves diagonaly to simulate a z-axis). This is so our player movement matches up with our artwork. We also use the delta time to smooth our movement across frames.

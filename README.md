# Let's Code an Indie Game!

*Let's code an Indie Game* is a youtube series looking at how to get started with independant game development using free and open source tools.
In the series we build a 2d game look at the following topics

- Writing code (using Lua and [Love2d](https://love2d.org/))
- Pixel Graphics (using [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/))
- Chiptunes (using [Milkytracker](http://milkytracker.titandemo.org/))


# Where can I watch?

A full list of episodes is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0RNVO6W3kbXRykE4VGcabQ).

# Who's it for?

A basic knowledge of programming may be useful (e.g. knowing what a function is) but beyond that the aim is to jump in and start doing,
the understanding comes with practice.

# Do you have a plan?

Not really, I'm going to make episodes as long as there is interest and/or it's fun.
I'm hoping to gather enough feedback and questions that future episodes can be planned according to what people would
find the most useful.

# Can I use the code?

Sure, the code from the episodes will be open source. Although I reserve the right to fork the code base and do my own thing,
I may also release a for-money version of the game with more/better art, music, features and online support at a later date.
